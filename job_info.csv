Beeswax,"New York, NY | Sr. Software Engineer | Full Time | ONSITE |Beeswax provides Real-Time Bidding as a service. If you’re not familiar with this world, we create software that advertisers use to bid on the opportunity to show an ad when someone loads a webpage or a mobile app. This means we handle massive scale (~1 million queries/second) and need to handle complex messages and large data sets with latencies under 20ms. On top of our technical challenges, we maintain an exhaustive list of bee-related puns and constantly keep coming up with new ones.After working together for several years on the Ads team at Google our three co-founders decided to start Beeswax because they saw a change in this market. Four years later their efforts have borne fruit and their predictions validated leading us to double in both revenue and team size over the past two years with a clear plan to double again this coming year.We’re a software company right down to our core with engineers from major tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook as well as engineers from many other excellent software cultures. Beeswax is well funded (RRE and Foundry Group amongst others) and far beyond the ramen hustle stage with benefits and a culture that encourages growth and long-term success. We are funded by leading angels from the ad tech ecosystem, in addition to Foundry Group, RRE, Highland Capital, SV Angels, and Revel PartnersWe're looking for both Sr. and Experienced Engineers to join our backend distributed systems teams which process more than 25 Billion events daily. We're fairly tech agnostic in regards to prior experience, however, this role would have you working with a tech stack built in production C++ & Python. Most of our team did not have this experience prior to joining Beeswax.At Beeswax we stand for:
Transparency: We pride ourselves on providing complete visibility into the successes, and sometimes failures, of our business as we grow and scale. It is an integral part of our culture as we collaborate and work towards a common goal across functions.Control: Control and ownership over individual business impacting projects empowers our employees to think critically and contribute to the development of Beeswax as an industry challenging platform.Flexibility: We empower our employees in a work environment that is conducive to creating the optimal work/life balance.website: https://www.beeswax.com/Job Link: https://boards.greenhouse.io/beeswax/jobs/683888"
Analytical Flavor Systems,"Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/ Position: Full-Stack Engineer, Application Engineer, DevOps, Data Scientist Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, GraphQL, Docker, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS Team: we're a diverse 6 person company (across Data, Engineering, Chemistry, and Biz). Everyone gets trained as a professional taster.Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products and optimize their existing brands by predicting the optimal flavor, aroma and texture for target consumer cohorts.Our Services_Innovation Management_: New product development, flavor profile optimization, & portfolio management (multi-product optimization)._Cognitive Marketing_: Product description optimization to prime consumers to like a product more by purposely engineering a perception bias._Deep Market Insights_: Predictions for emergent market preferences by region and demographic.The Position(s)_Engineering_: We're currently looking in two specific areas: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Streaming infrastructure focused engineers capable of integrating the data pipeline and outputs of machine learning models into an easy to use management platform._Data Science_: Data science is central to the value and insights we provide for our clients. We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. We are a team of data scientists that understand our clients and turn nebulous business goal into quantitative decision metrics and predictive models to optimize those metrics. The extensive role of data scientists at Analytical Flavor Systems allows us to invest in their education across sensory perception (standard sensory science so they know what we're improving and replacing), tasting experiences (so they appreciate the products we work on and understand how the data is collected), production knowledge, and data science tear-downs (a meeting where the team collaboratively attempts to find and fix problems, try new techniques, and debate the philosophical implications of a model's construction).Next StepsPlease contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply."
Originate,"NYC, SF, LA | Senior Product Designer, Senior Engineer, Senior Product Manager | https://jobs.lever.co/originate | REMOTE | Salary ~120-150K‌‌~~ hope you are having a nice december‌ ‌~~Originate was founded in 2007 and we're a concept-to-launch software consultancy. We partner with our clients to build products of all shapes and sizes. If you worked here, you would get to learn a lot of different tech stacks, how lots of different industries operate, and build a lot of cool products with cool people. We strongly believe in a healthy work-life balance, we have 20% time for engineers to work on their own projects, and we have a generous vacation policy. We are primarily looking to staff our NYC/LA/SF offices BUT we do also have remote positions -- we have a strong remote culture -- available so please reach out to us through Lever even if that is a concern for you.Because we're a consultancy we don't have one fixed tech stack, but I can tell you about the projects I've worked on. It's been a while but the most exotic stack I've worked on was Haskell with Servant, Warp, lenses, all that good stuff. We have several 20% projects using Rust, including one that lets you compose binaural, microtonal music <https://github.com/xasopheno/WereSoCool>. We, of course, build tons of React/Redux apps for browsers; our favorite new thing in the NYC office is to use yarn workspaces so that the Node.js backend and the React frontend share the same Flow or TypeScript types between them. That way you never have to worry about the data on the wire being malformed. We've also been on more Go, Scala, and Swift/iOS projects than you can shake a stick at.Also, fun fact: One of the lesser-known perks of working at a (product-oriented) consultancy like ours is that you rarely have to deal with technical debt. You get to use modern tooling most of the time because you're always starting a project from scratch. It's great! Tooling-wise we're big believers in continuous integration (usually CircleCI) and deployment (also usually CircleCI even though it's not always great for that). We use GitHub for everything. Our devops team uses Terraform and AWS, very standard. No surprises! If you love working with top-of-the-line tools, you should check us out.My personal email is hao.lian@originate.com if you want to reach out to me. You can just ask me Haskell questions! Doesn't have to be about a job. I work in the NYC office on 10 Crosby St so if you are in NYC we should at the very least grab a coffee. Also I'm @hlian on GitHub if you want to peruse all my semi-abandoned personal projects :)"
Knotel,"multiple positions | New York, NY | onsite | Full-time | https://www.knotel.comKnotel is a fast growing commercial real estate startup that is inventing new ways to get things done in a traditional industry. Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are building internal tools to increase our efficiency as a company. We are rolling out a data pipeline and ensuring all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control. We're looking to use computer vision to understand office utilization and flow within the office.In brief, we have a ton of interesting problems to solve.We're growing our engineering team in NYC significantly, starting with some key roles.Today we're hiring a whole bunch of roles:- Lead Full Stack Engineer https://grnh.se/91ad31da1- Data Engineer https://grnh.se/d5c41fd31- Senior DevOps Engineer https://grnh.se/e43371b81- Full Stack Engineers https://grnh.se/a0d117a21- Director of Engineering (job posting coming soon)- QA Engineer (job posting coming soon)Any questions, feel free to email me victor [at] knotel dot com"
