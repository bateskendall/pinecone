# Pinecone

A web scraper that searches through a Hacker News hiring thread and filters out all listings except those in a given city (in my case, New York). For ease of use, the tool then throws those results into a .csv file, so you can send the findings wherever you please.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Then run the program:

```
$ ruby main.rb
```

See job_info.csv for example results!
